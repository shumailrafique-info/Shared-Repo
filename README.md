Hey :D you must love the code  This is my First MERN Project in my carrier.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------Starting Guide on Localhost
1: First install Node-Module in Your Binyousaf Clone APp.
2: And run this command "npm intall" to make sure evething is Updated.
3: Type "nodemon server.js" or "npm run dev" both command work for starting a App on localhost.
4: ðŸ˜Œ Note: The Frontend Folder is not Present inside the Repo. Frontend is compress in the Build. You can't explore this.


#----------------------------------------------------------------- The ERROR may be  You face during Starting.
1: Youe Node.js is Version is not same as my app Node version it is horrible Error if you faced the first time.

2: Pictue is not showing on the Category Reason : 1 You need to connect wih your "MongoDb Compus" or "Monogo DB Atlas" both have a choice.
Search about it how to connect node.js wih mongoDB Commpus or Atlas whatever you choose. 

3: Create a env file with an server.js file 
Create a env variable to use a global like PORT , EMAIL , PASSWORD.
1: Choose a PORT NUmber.I prefer choose this "PORT = 2999"
2: Choose a EMAIL, PASSWORD.  like this.
EMAIL = your@gmail.com 
PASSWORD = gmailpasskey

If you have not  a gmail pass key  then use ethereal smtp sever. You can able to start app and Send email with contact form.

4: If you are not able to see image in category Because You not upload image on Databse You need to make a Database name in mogoDB and make a it collections I  mention below all of this.
# Datbase name Binyousaf

Collection name
# State


5: If you want to see the Admin panel  First make a object like this in "State" Collection
register : false
register is a key and false is value it must be bollean true or false. if you set the true then you can able to see the register button  on this page "https://binyousaf-clone.onrender.com/login"
You can easily register with that. if you set it false then you can't not able to see the register button.
after you can register and login then you can easily add a product in "Categoryies" collecion. with the help of admin panel.



Good luck..... ðŸ™Œ
